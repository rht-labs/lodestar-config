# Lodestar - Config

The Configuration API for Lodestar.

## Runtime Configurations

The base runtime configuration is a Yaml file.  The only required contents for the base configuration is the following:

```
basic_information:
  engagement_types:
    options:
      - label: Type One
        value: TypeOne
      - label: TypeTwo
        value: TypeTwo
```

The options list in the `engagement_types` will be used to determine if there are any override files to merge. Base config values can be added to or overriden using override files with the naming scheme `<base-file-name>-<engagement_type_value>.yaml`.

For example:

If the base configuration name is `runtime-config.yaml` and you wanted to add to or override values for engagement type TypeTwo, you would need to create a mounted file with the name `runtime-config-typetwo.yaml`.

If no file found matching the value of the engagement type, the base config will be returned.

### Runtime Configuration Merging

- All entries in the base config and not in the override config will be included
- All entries in the override config and not in the base config will be included
- All entries, excluding lists, that are in both the base and override configuration will use the values in the override config
- **Any list that is in both base and override configs will be replaced with the values in the override config***

# JSON REST API

## OpenAPI Documentation of APIs

The JSON APIs are documented using using OpenAPI.  The OpenAPI UI can be used to view the exposed endpoints and interact directly with them.

Once the application is launched, the OpenAPI UI can be found at the following path:

```
http(s)://your-hostname[:port]/q/swagger-ui
```

## Available Resources

### RuntimeConfig

The runtime config resource exposes an endpoints that allow clients to retrieve the base runtime configuration or the base configuration merged with a specific engagement type configuration.

`GET /engagements`

The following parameters are supported:

Query Params:
  * `type` - engagement type value listed in the base configuration file.
